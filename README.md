# smartphone-ph

Android app for interfacing with the smartphone-based pH sensor designed by the BIOEE group at University of California, San Diego (http://bioee.ucsd.edu). This app provides power to and communicates with the device to monitor and track the pH and temperature of user samples. It also incorporates validated quality of life questionnaires, such as the UCSD Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (SOBQ) and the CF Questionnaire Revised (CFQR) to correlate disease activity with the quantitative data collected.
